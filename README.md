# Visualizing Air Quality

## Project Idea
* Visualise the uncertainty associated with data collected from the two official stations
* Plot routes around the two stations for the bike, ride those routes once or more times
* The bike data will show how well the station predicts the measurements surrounding the station
* Part I: Turn this into a scrollytelling story about uncertainty and reliability of stationary air quality measurements: Air quality is in the news and most people never question how it is measured. We can educate them on how the measurements are made and how meaningful they really are.
  * Technology: Website made with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, D3, Leaflet
* Part II: Create an AR application with which people can walk around the station and see the air quality visualized as a "mist" to provide a more playful way of interacting with the data
  * Unity, City Engine, maybe SketchUp
