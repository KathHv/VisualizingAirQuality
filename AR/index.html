          <h3> How to use the AR application </h3>
          <p>
            The AR application displays the air quality around the Geistviertel in Münster at two different times.
            An arrow directing to the next route point is displayed in the middle of the AR screen. <br>
            When you follow it the amount of particles will change since the value of PM10 varies. <br>
            <br>
            We decided for a route around the LANUV station in the Geistviertel to show whether the measurements of the LANUV station is representative or not. <br>
            More information about this station can be found below. <br>
            The start point of the tour is at point A on the map (51.9521303, 7.6167933; Geiststraße B, 48151 Münster). This is the tour:

          </iframe>
          <p> Along the cycled route, there are serveral "guide sign areas". Those areas are marked with a red circle in the AR.
            When you enter one, you gain information about the place and why there might be a special situation for air quality measurements.
            They are not only placed at striking points but also at averaging places. Some guide sign areas focus on the varieties of the different rides.

          <h3> Weather conditions </h3>
            THe 14th of November 2019 an dthe 19th of December 2019 had more or less the same weather conditions: <br>
            Passing clouds, some sun's rays and wind of 9 to 11km per hour out of east-south-eastern direction.<br>
            There was a pressure of 1003mbar respectively 1008mbar with 69% relative humidity.<br>
            The main difference was in the temperature. ON the 14th of November 2019 it was 6 to 8°C warm. <br>
            On 19th of December there was a temperature of 11-14°C.<br>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <h4>LANUV stations</h4>
            These are official air quality measurement stations. The Bundesumweltamt places them at certain points all over Germany.
            Münster has two: One stands next to the Weselerstraße as a traffic measurement station.
            The otherone located in the Geistviertel next to the Ludwig-Erhardt-Berufskolleg as a background station in a residential area.
            The Bundesumweltamt provides averaged hourly PM10 data rounded to microgramm.
            More information about the criteria for placements and the technical properties of the stations can be reached
            <a href=\"https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/luqs/messorte/steckbrief.php?ort=MSGE\"> here </a>
            for station in Geistviertel and
            <a href=\"https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/luqs/messorte/steckbrief.php?ort=VMS2\"> here </a> for the station at the Weselerstraße.

            <h4>Sensebox</h4>
            With very kind support of the Sensebox Lap at the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of Münster we were able to measure air quality place indepenent.
            While going by bike we measured independently next to the LANUV station in the Geistviertel so that we can have a look on changes in the
            air quality during the bike ride since there is only one averaged measurement published by LANUV. For measuring PM10 we used the <a href=\"https://sensebox.kaufen/product/feinstaub-sds01w1\"> Sensor sds01w1</a>
            with a <a href=\"https://sensebox.kaufen/product/sensebox-home\"> Sensebox Home kit </a>.

            <h4>Bike</h4>
            With support of the Climatology Lab of the Institute for Landscape Ecology by Prof. Dr. Otto Klemm at the University of Münster we were able to do two bike rides.
            The bike measures environmental data including PM10 data. Therefore, they are using the following sensores: </p>
