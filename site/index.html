				<h1 class="intro__hed">How reliable are air quality measurements</h1>
				<h2 class="head2">The WHYs and WHATs of air quality and its quantification</h2>
				<p class="intro__dek">
					Air is essentially one of the most important resources for our body and rightly so, air quality has been a target for today’s media. About 78% of air is made up of nitrogen and oxygen constitutes about 21%. The rest is made up of different gasses like methane, CO2, CO. But that’s not all! The air we breathe also has some harmful particles called PM or Particulate Matter. They are broadly categorised into PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers respectively. By comparision, a human hair is between 50-70 micrometers. Dust and smoke are obvious visible examples of particulate matter but more than 90% remains invisible. Sources include agriculture, coal mining and landfills, energy production, road transport, burning fossil fuels and so on (EEA)…
				</p>
				<p class="intro_dek>
					  Unfortunately, these particles have major effects on health, causing cancer, inflammation to premature deaths (WHO 2013). Evidences of outdoor quality affecting the air inside buildings are plentiful. Some say the quality outside might be better than inside the buildings (EEA).
					  </p>
				<p class="intro_dek">
						    Measurement instruments have been deployed all over Europe in order to assess and control the quality of air. But the fact that these instruments are neither cheap nor small prohibits easy and widespread deployment. As is with all machines, the accuracy of these measurements varies. It is possible that the air quality on the street next to the deployed instrument might be different if there is a tall building in between them. Uncertainties in these measurements can stem from a lot of factors like the location of the instrument, hardware capabilities, sensor quality, and time of measurements. The Landscape ecology group at the University of Muenster has come up with a mobile solution for measuring air quality. They retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality measurement unit measuring different kinds of particles. The Institute or Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has their citizen science project called Sensebox, where they provide Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits. All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be identified. Together they can make up a reliable network of air quality measurement instruments but the uncertainties still prevail.
