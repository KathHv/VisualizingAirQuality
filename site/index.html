				<p class="intro__dek" id="introp">
					Air is essentially one of the most important resources for our body and rightly so, air quality has been a target for today’s media. About 78% of air is made up of nitrogen and oxygen constitutes about 21%. The rest is made up of different gasses like methane, CO2, CO. But that’s not all! The air we breathe also has some harmful particles called PM or Particulate Matter. They are broadly categorised into PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers and 2.5 micrometers respectively. By comparision, a human hair is between 50-70 micrometers. Dust and smoke are obvious visible examples of particulate matter but more than 90% remains invisible. Sources include agriculture, coal mining and landfills, energy production, road transport, burning fossil fuels and so on (EEA)…
				</p>
				<p id="introp">
					  Unfortunately, these particles have major effects on health, causing cancer, inflammation to premature deaths (WHO 2013). Evidences of outdoor quality affecting the air inside buildings are plentiful. Some say the quality outside might be better than inside the buildings (EEA).
