				<h1>Air Quality: How much can we trust official data?</h1>
				<h2>Investigating PM10 data for Münster</h2>

				<p>
					Air quality and its effects has been a target for today’s media. The
					air we breathe does carry some harmful particles called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates#Health_effects">PM</a> or
					<u>P</u>articulate <u>M</u>atter. They are broadly categorised into 
					PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10 
					micrometers and
					2.5 micrometers respectively. To put it in numbers, an average human
					inhales around 12-16 times per minute.
					This corresponds to approximately 13 kg of air daily. Out of the
					recommended standard for PM inhalation by World Health Organization
					(WHO), we reach about 75% of that limit daily and this number will
					continue to grow with more urbanization and industrialization. This
					also affects indoor air quality. Unfortunately, these particles have
					major effects on our health. A 2013 report by
					<a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/"
						>WHO</a
					>
					states, a poor ambient air quality can cause cancer, inflammation to
					premature deaths.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We are notified about the air quality around us through measurement
					instruments deployed in various parts of our cities. But the
					measurements reported have some uncertainties or errors associated
					with them. These can be broadly divided into three categories:
				</p>
				<br />
				<div id="sectionList">
					<a class="colourSectionA" href="#headingA">
						<b>Measurement (hardware-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						The capability and accuracy of the instrument varies with its
						hardware quality. A cheaper instrument may give flawed measurements.
					</a>
					<a class="colourSectionB" href="#headingB">
						<b>Temporal (time-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						A calculated average of all values of measurements over one hour or
						a day does not really reflect the true measurement at a point in
						time. An hourly average can be misleading.
					</a>
					<a class="colourSectionC" href="#headingC">
						<b>Spatial (distance-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						A fixed instrument at a location might not be able to accurately
						measure air quality at the other end of the city. One value for an
						entire city can be misleading as well.
					</a>
					<br />

							<p>
								Measurement instruments like this have been deployed all over
								Europe to assess and control the quality of air. But the fact
								that these instruments are neither cheap nor small prohibits
								easy and widespread deployment. As is with all machines, the
								accuracy of these measurements varies.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								For the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, you can see an overview
								of the hourly updated measured values of various components on
								the
								<a
									href="https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/umwelt/luft/immissionen/aktuelle-luftqualitaet/partikel-pm25-feinstaub"
									>LANUV</a
								>
								website and a calculated air quality index on
								<a href="https://www.aqicn.org/map/germany/">aqicn.org</a>.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								But that’s not all.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>
								The Institute of Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has
								their citizen science project called
								<a href="https://sensebox.github.io/en/">SenseBox</a>, where
								they provide Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits.It is
								capable of measuring PM10 and PM2.5 with a wide range of sensors
								configurations.
							</p>
							<p>
								The data can be shared using their
								<a href="https://opensensemap.org/">openSenseMap</a>. It is a
								publicly affordable version of the LANUV stations. But the
								qualty of hardware introduces some uncertainty and can be less
								accurate than a full-powered LANUV station.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Along with such initiatives, there are researchers working on
								measuring air quality.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>
								An example would be the Landscape ecology group at the
								University of Muenster and their mobile air quality measurement
								instrument. They have retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality
								measurement unit measuring different kinds of particles.
							</p>
							<p>
								This bike can be ridden around the city and can measure air
								quality. As the bike is capable of carrying a larger load, the
								sensors quality is between Sensebox and LANUV. But the bike has 
								a power limitation since it relies on Lithium batteries for sensors.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<p>
								All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be
								identified. Sensebox as the most affordable, The bike as
								a mobile sensor and LANUV as the industrial sensor used for 
								official purposes. Together they can make up a reliable network 
								of air quality measurement instruments.
							</p>
							<p>
								But other uncertainties still prevail.

								Official LANUV stations only publish data averaged for one hour. 
								But it just so happens that the air quality
								around you can be disrupted by ,for example, the vehicles
								driving around you. This is an instantaneous change not reflected in 
								measurements taken by a station at the other end of
								the city.
							</p>
							<p>
								The map shows two stations in Muenster with the values of PM10
								through out the day as you scroll the timer above changes and so do
								the measurements. Different colors show different values. The scale on 
								the bottom right shows the range of measurements.
							</p>
							<p>
								We know PM 2.5 are considered more dangerous than PM 10 but 
								the stations in Muenster do not measure PM2.5 at all.  

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>
								Therefore, We used the bike to cover the area around one of the
								stations (Muenster-Geist) to understand if the air quality differs
								as we move away from the station. We rode around smaller and larger
								streets, parks and some traffic-dense areas.
							</p>
							<p>
								We found a considerable rise and fall in PM10 values for streets
								around the station. Some anomalies were introduced by cars
								passing by corresponding to the high values on map. Officially,
								we have just a single value of PM10 for the entire bike ride to
								compare to. You can see how much the values vary.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<div class="stepInner">
								<p>Time:</p>
								<p class="progress"></p>
							</div>
							<p>
								For a more consistant comparision, we also used a sensebox at a
								fixed location next to the LANUV station. The sensebox measures
								PM10 every second but is also stationary. This made it a perfect
								crossover between LANUV and the bike. As seen here, the PM10 values 
								measured by sensebox also vary a lot in one hour.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<div class="stepInner">
								<p>Time:</p>
								<p class="progress"></p>
							</div>
							<p>
								Through out study, We found that LANUV stations measure accurately
								but can't measure the air quality at the other end of the city. The 
								bike can measure at various locations but it only measures once at a location
								and moves on. It's also not possible for the bike to be driven continuously.
								A sensebox can be a preliminary source if enough of them are deployed 
								but sensor quality matters. But if all are represented together, they can be
								a reliable source of information.

								Imagine you are standing at the red spot and you want to know the
								air quality. A simplistic approach would be to check the measurement
								at the nearest station, say the one at Weseler Str. Now this is a pretty 
								busy street. But you have no cars going around you. The measurement you get 
								would be way higher than it is at your location.
