				<h1>How reliable are air quality measurements?</h1>
				<h2>
					The WHYs and WHATs of air quality and its quantification
				</h2>
				<p>
					Air is essentially one of the most important resources for our body and rightly so, 
					air quality has been a target for today’s media. The air we breathe can carry some 
					harmful particles called PM or Particulate Matter. They are broadly categorised into 
					PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers and 2.5 
					micrometers respectively. To put it in numbers, an average human being breaths around 
					12-16 times per minute during normal activity. This corresponds to approximately 13 kg 
					of air daily. Out of the recommended standard for PM inhalation by WHO, we reach about 
					75% of that limit daily and this number will continue to grow with more urbanization 
					and industrialization. This also affects indoor air quality.Unfortunately, these particles
					have major effects on health, causing cancer, inflammation to premature deaths (WHO 2013).

				</p>
				<p>
					We are notified about the air quality around us through measurement instruments placed 
					all around us. These instruments, however carry some uncertainties. These can be broadly
					divided into three categories: 
					
				</p>
				
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li>Measurement uncertainty - The capability and accuracy of the instrument varies with 
						its hardware quality. A cheaper instrument may give flawed measurements.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Temporal uncertainty - A calculated average of all values of measurements does not 
						really reflect the true situation. An hourly average can be misleading.</li>
					<br>
					<li>Spatial uncertainty - A fixed instrument at a location might not be able to 
						accurately measure air quality at the other end of the city. One value for an 
						entire city can be misleading as well.</li>
					<br>
				</ul>

			<h2>Measurement Uncertainty</h2>

			<section id="scrollyA" class="scrolly">
				<!-- individual text boxes on the left -->
				<article>
					<div class="step" data-step="1">
						<p>
							Measurement instruments like this have been deployed all over Europe 
							to assess and control the quality of air. But the fact that these 
							instruments are neither cheap nor small prohibits easy and widespread 
							deployment. As is with all machines, the accuracy of these measurements 
							varies. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							For the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, you can see an overview 
							of the hourly updated measured values of various components on the 
							<a href="https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/umwelt/luft/immissionen/aktuelle-luftqualitaet/partikel-pm25-feinstaub">LANUV</a> website 
							and a calculated air quality index on <a href="aqicn.org/map/germany/">aqicn.org</a>.

						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							But that’s not all.
						</p>
						
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>
							The Institute of Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has their 
							citizen science project called Sensebox, where they provide 
							Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits called <a href="https://sensebox.github.io/en/">SenseBox</a>. It’s a self 
							assembly kit capable of measuring PM10 and PM2.5 with a wide range of 
							sensors for ambient lighting, temperature, barometric pressure, etc.  
							
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							
							This instrument can be purchased and deployed outside individual homes 
							and the data can be shared using their <a href="https://opensensemap.org/">openSenseMap</a>, an open source 
							platform for sharing sensebox data. It is a publicly affordable version 
							of the LANUV stations. But the hardware introduces some uncertainty and 
							can be less accurate than a full-powered LANUV station.

						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							Along with such initiatives, there are researchers working on measuring air quality.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>
							An example would be the Landscape ecology group at the University of 
							Muenster has come up with a mobile solution for measuring air quality. 
							They retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality measurement unit measuring
							different kinds of particles. 
							
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							
							The bike can be ridden around the city and
							can measure particles as well as temperature and pressure. As the bike 
							is capable of carrying a larger load, the sensors fitted are of a better
							quality than the sensebox but still not as powerful as the LANUV. 

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>
							All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be identified. 
							Sensebox as the most affordable and therefore easily deployable providing
							a large network of sensors, The bike as more of a research oriented but 
							a mobile sensor and LANUV as the industrial sensor used for official 
							purposes. 
							
						</p>
						<br>
						<br>
						<p>
							
							Together they can make up a reliable network of air quality 
							measurement instruments but other uncertainties still prevail.
