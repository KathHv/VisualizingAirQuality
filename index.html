				<h1>How reliable are air quality measurements?</h1>
				<h2>
					The WHYs and WHATs of air quality and its quantification
				</h2>
				<p>
					Air is essentially one of the most important resources for our body
					and rightly so, air quality has been a target for today’s media. About
					78% of air is made up of nitrogen and oxygen constitutes about 21%.
					The rest is made up of different gasses like methane, CO2, CO. But
					that’s not all! The air we breathe also has some harmful particles
					called PM or Particulate Matter. They are broadly categorised into
					PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10
					micrometers and 2.5 micrometers respectively. By comparison, a human
					hair is between 50-70 micrometers. Dust and smoke are obvious visible
					examples of particulate matter but more than 90% remains invisible.
					Sources include agriculture, coal mining and landfills, energy
					production, road transport, burning fossil fuels and so on (EEA)…
				</p>
				<p>
					Unfortunately, these particles have major effects on health, causing
					cancer, inflammation to premature deaths (WHO 2013). To put it in
					numbers, an average human being breaths around 12-16 times per minute
					during normal activity. This corresponds to approximately 13 kg of air
					daily. Out of the recommended standard for PM inhalation by WHO, we
					reach about 75% of that limit daily and this number will continue to
					grow with more urbanization and industrialization. This also affects
					indoor air quality as evidence of outdoor quality affecting the air
					inside buildings are plentiful. Some say the quality outside might be
					better than inside the buildings (EEA).

						<p>
							Measurement instruments have been deployed all over Europe in
							order to assess and control the quality of air. But the fact that
							these instruments are neither cheap nor small prohibits easy and
							widespread deployment. As is with all machines, the accuracy of
							these measurements varies. It is possible that the air quality on
							the street next to the deployed instrument might be different if
							there is a tall building in between them. Uncertainties in these
							measurements can stem from a lot of factors like the location of
							the instrument, hardware capabilities, sensor quality, and time of
							measurements.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>
							The Institute of Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has
							their citizen science project called Sensebox, where they provide
							Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>
							The Landscape ecology group at the University of Muenster has come
							up with a mobile solution for measuring air quality. They
							retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality measurement unit
							measuring different kinds of particles.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>
							All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be
							identified. Together they can make up a reliable network of air
							quality measurement instruments but the uncertainties still
							prevail.
