				<h1>Air Quality: How much can we trust official data?</h1>
				<h2>Investigating PM10 data for Münster</h2>
				<hr />
				<p>
					Air quality and its effects has been a target for today’s media. The
					air we breathe does carry some harmful particles called
					<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particulates#Health_effects"
						>PM</a
					>
					or <u>P</u>articulate <u>M</u>atter. They are broadly categorised into
					PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10
					micrometers and 2.5 micrometers respectively.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					An average human inhales around 12-16 times per minute. This
					corresponds to approximately 13 kg of air daily. Out of the
					recommended standard for PM inhalation by World Health Organization
					(WHO), we reach about 75% of that limit daily and this number will
					continue to grow with more urbanization and industrialization.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					Unfortunately, these particles have major effects on our health. A
					2013 report by
					<a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/"
						>WHO</a
					>
					states, a poor ambient air quality can cause cancer, inflammation to
					premature deaths.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					We are notified about the air quality around us through measurement
					instruments deployed in various parts of our cities. But the
					measurements reported have some uncertainties or errors associated
					with them. These can be broadly divided into three categories:
				</p>
				<br />
				<div id="sectionList">
					<a class="colourSectionA" href="#headingA">
						<b>Measurement (hardware-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						The capability and accuracy of the instrument varies with its
						hardware quality. A cheaper instrument may be less accurate.
					</a>
					<a class="colourSectionB" href="#headingB">
						<b>Temporal (time-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						A calculated average of all values of measurements over one hour or
						a day does not really reflect the true measurement at a point in
						time. An hourly average can be misleading.
					</a>
					<a class="colourSectionC" href="#headingC">
						<b>Spatial (distance-based) uncertainty</b> <br />
						A fixed instrument at a location might not be able to accurately
						measure air quality at the other end of the city. One value for an
						entire city can be misleading as well.
					</a>

								Instruments like this have been deployed all over Germany to
								measure the quality of air. But these instruments are neither
								cheap nor small. This hinders easy and widespread deployment.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								For the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, you can see an overview
								of the hourly updated measured values of various parameters on
								the
								<a
									href="https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/umwelt/luft/immissionen/aktuelle-luftqualitaet/partikel-pm25-feinstaub"
									>LANUV</a
								>
								website and a calculated air quality index (AQI) on
								<a href="https://www.aqicn.org/map/germany/">aqicn.org</a>.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								But that’s not all.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>
								The Institute of Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has
								their citizen science project called
								<a href="https://sensebox.github.io/en/">SenseBox</a>, where
								they provide Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits. It is
								capable of measuring PM10 and PM2.5 with a wide range of sensors
								configurations. But the qualty of hardware introduces accuracy
								issues.
							</p>
							<p>
								The data can be shared using their
								<a href="https://opensensemap.org/">openSenseMap</a>.
							</p>
							<br />
							<p>
								Along with such initiatives, there are researchers working on
								measuring air quality.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>
								An example would be the Landscape ecology group at the
								University of Muenster and their mobile air quality measurement
								instrument. They have retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality
								measurement instrument
							</p>
							<p>
								This bike can be ridden around the city and can measure air
								quality while moving. As the bike is capable of carrying a
								larger load, the sensors quality is between Sensebox and LANUV.
								But the bike has a power limitation since it relies on Lithium
								batteries for sensors.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<p>
								All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be
								identified. Sensebox as the most affordable, The bike as a
								mobile sensor with a better instrument and LANUV as the
								industrial sensor used for official purposes.

								Official stations only publish data averaged over one hour. But
								it just so happens that the air quality around you can be
								disrupted by ,for example, the vehicles driving around you. This
								is an instantaneous change and will not be reflected in an
								hourly update.
							</p>
							<p>
								The map shows two stations in Muenster with the values of PM10
								through out the day. As you scroll, the timer above changes and
								so do the measurements. Different colors show different values.
								The scale on the bottom right shows the range of measurements.
							</p>
							<p>
								We know PM 2.5 are considered more dangerous than PM 10 but the
								official stations in Muenster do not measure PM 2.5 at all.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>
								Therefore, we used the bike to cover the area around one of the
								stations (Muenster-Geist) to understand if the air quality
								differs drastically in one hour.
							</p>
							<p>
								We found a considerable rise and fall in PM 10. Some anomalies
								were introduced by cars passing by corresponding to the high
								values on map. Officially, we have a single value of PM10 for
								the entire bike ride to compare to. You can see how much the air
								quality varies.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<div class="stepInner">
								<p>Time:</p>
								<p class="progress"></p>
							</div>
							<p>
								For a more consistant comparision, we also deployed a sensebox
								next to the LANUV station. The sensebox measures PM 10 every
								1/4<sup>th</sup> second. This made it a perfect crossover
								between LANUV and the bike. As seen here, the PM10 values
								measured by sensebox also vary a lot in one hour.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<div class="stepInner">
								<p>Time:</p>
								<p class="progress"></p>
							</div>
							<p>
								We can say that the data published by LANUV can be misleading as
								it does not reflect changes in that hour. The bike reports many
								times during an hour but it only measures once at a location and
								moves on. A sensebox can be a preliminary source if enough of
								them are deployed but sensor quality matters.

						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="2">
							<p>
								A simplistic approach would be to check the measurement at the
								nearest station, say the one at Weseler Strasse which is a busy
								street. The measurement would be way higher than it is at your
								location as you would be standing on a quiet street.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="3">
							<p>
								A scientific approach to this would involve calculating
								interpolations based on the measurements from the bike. This
								method gives you an estimate of the air quality.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="step" data-step="4">
							<p>
								However, its still an estimate. The bike route does not pass
								close by the location where you stand. The accuracy of
								interpolations reduces as you move away from the actual
								measurement. Moreover, no information on the surroundings
								(buildings, resulting air circulation, type of road, traffic,
								industry, etc.) was taken into account.

					Air quality measurement is not an easy task considering the
					uncertainties it introduces in the measurement. The accuracy of
					measurements will increase with the number of instruments. The three
					types of instruments mentioned above can be a reliable source of
					information as they cover up the uncertainties which are most
					important.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					But there are so many factors which still affect the air quality.
					Weather is one of such factors. A strong wind or rain affects the air
					quality drastically. Sunshine causes some pollutants to undergo
					chemical reactions, producing smog. Higher temperatures speed up
					chemical reactions in the air as well.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					This website is designed to be an information platform about the
					various challanges in air quality measurement. It is a top-down
					perspective about measurement uncertainties over an entire city. We
					also created an AR app for an immersive experience. It shows air
					quality information at your location. Click the button below.
