				<h1>How reliable are air quality measurements?</h1>
				<h2>
					The <i>WHYs</i> and <i>WHATs</i> of air quality and its quantification
				</h2>
				<p>
					Air is essentially one of the most important resources for our body and rightly so, 
					air quality has been a target for today’s media. The air we breathe can carry some 
					harmful particles called PM or Particulate Matter. They are broadly categorised into 
					PM10 and PM 2.5 corresponding to particulate matter smaller than 10 micrometers and 2.5 
					micrometers respectively. To put it in numbers, an average human being breaths around 
					12-16 times per minute during normal activity. This corresponds to approximately 13 kg 
					of air daily. Out of the recommended standard for PM inhalation by World Health Organization 
					(WHO), we reach about 75% of that limit daily and this number will continue to grow with more urbanization 
					and industrialization. This also affects indoor air quality.Unfortunately, these particles
					have major effects on our health A 2013 report by <a href="https://www.who.int/airpollution/ambient/health-impacts/en/">WHO</a>
					states, a poor ambient air quality can cause cancer, inflammation to premature deaths.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					We are notified about the air quality around us through measurement instruments deployed  
					in various parts of our cities. But the measurements reported have some uncertainties or errors associated with them. 
					These can be broadly divided into three categories: 
					
				</p>
				<br>
				<ul style="list-style-type:square;">
					<li><b>Measurement uncertainty</b> - The capability and accuracy of the instrument varies with 
						its hardware quality. A cheaper instrument may give flawed measurements.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Temporal uncertainty</b> - A calculated average of all values of measurements over one hour or a day does not 
						really reflect the true measurement at a point in time. An hourly average can be misleading.</li>
					<br>
					<li><b>Spatial uncertainty</b> - A fixed instrument at a location might not be able to 
						accurately measure air quality at the other end of the city. One value for an 
						entire city can be misleading as well.</li>
					<br>
				</ul>
			</section>

			<h2>Measurement Uncertainty</h2>

			<section id="scrollyA" class="scrolly">
				<!-- individual text boxes on the left -->
				<article>
					<div class="step" data-step="1">
						<p>
							Measurement instruments like this have been deployed all over Europe 
							to assess and control the quality of air. But the fact that these 
							instruments are neither cheap nor small prohibits easy and widespread 
							deployment. As is with all machines, the accuracy of these measurements 
							varies. 
						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							For the state of North Rhine-Westphalia, you can see an overview 
							of the hourly updated measured values of various components on the 
							<a href="https://www.lanuv.nrw.de/umwelt/luft/immissionen/aktuelle-luftqualitaet/partikel-pm25-feinstaub">LANUV</a> website 
							and a calculated air quality index on <a href="https://www.aqicn.org/map/germany/">aqicn.org</a>.

						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							But that’s not all.
						</p>
						
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>
							The Institute of Geoinformatics at University of Muenster has their 
							citizen science project called <a href="https://sensebox.github.io/en/">SenseBox</a>, where they provide 
							Do-It-Yourself air quality measurement kits.It is capable of measuring PM10 and 
							PM2.5 with a wide range of sensors configurations.  
							
						</p>
						<p>
							
							The data can be shared using their <a href="https://opensensemap.org/">openSenseMap</a>.
							It is a publicly affordable version of the LANUV stations. But the qualty of 
							hardware introduces some uncertainty and can be less accurate than a full-powered LANUV station.

						</p>
						<br>
						<p>
							Along with such initiatives, there are researchers working on measuring air quality.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>
							An example would be the Landscape ecology group at the University of 
							Muenster and their mobile air quality measurement instrument. They have 
							retrofitted a bicycle with an air quality measurement unit measuring
							different kinds of particles. 
							
						</p>
						<p>
							
							This bike can be ridden around the city and can measure air quality. As the bike
							is capable of carrying a larger load, the sensors fitted are of a better quality
							than the sensebox but still not as powerful as the LANUV. 

						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>
							All in all, three levels of measurement instruments can be identified. 
							Sensebox as the most affordable and therefore easily deployable providing
							a large network of sensors, The bike as more of a research oriented but 
							a mobile sensor and LANUV as the industrial sensor used for official 
							purposes. 
							
						</p>
						<p>
							
							Together they can make up a reliable network of air quality 
							measurement instruments but other uncertainties still prevail. Temporal uncertainties 
							can stem from mathematical processing of the raw data as seen below

			<h2>Temporal (time-based) Uncertainty</h2>

					<div class="step" data-step="1">
						<p>
							Official LANUV stations publish an hourly update, meaning they calculate averages oo
							all values in an hour providinag 24 values for a single day. But it just so 
							happens that the air quality around you can be disrupted by ,for example, the 
							vehicles driving around you. Waiting at a signal with a lot of vehicles during
							rush hour can introduce lots of particles in the immidiate environment. A measurement 
							station at the other end of the city is incapable of informing you about this.
						</p>
						<p>
							The map shows two stations in Muenster with the values of PM10 throughout the day 
							represented by the dots of a single colour corrosponding to one value for an hour.
						</p>
						<p>
							The stations in Muenster do not measure PM2.5 at all. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="2">
						<p>
							Therefore, We used the bike to cover the area around one of the stations 
							(Muenster-Geist) to understand how reliable the measurement of LANUV can be. We rode
							around smaller and larger streets, parks and some traffic-dense areas starting from the 
							Schloss for about an hour and half. The bike has a power limitation since it is a mobile
							device and relies on Lithium batteries for powering the sensors.
						</p>
						<p>
							We found a considerable rise and fall in PM10 values for streets around the station. 
							Some anomalies were introduced by cars passing by corrosponding to the high values on 
							map. Officially, we have just a single value of PM10 for the entire bike ride to compare to.
							You can see how much the values vary.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="3">
						<p>
							For a more consistant compairision, we also used a sensebox at a fixed location next to the
							LANUV station. The sensebox measures PM10 every second making it a closly comparable source
							of information to the bike. As seen here, the PM10 values measured by sensebox , represented 
							by the smaller dots inside the LANUV data, also vary a lot in one hour as seen by 
							the changes in the colour.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="step" data-step="4">
						<p>
							Through out study, We were able to confer that the bike can provide a consistant measurement for 
							large areas and a much shorter temporal range giving 'close-to-real-life' PM10 values. But it's 
							not possible for the bike to be driven through out the day, throughout the year. A sensebox can 
							be a consistant source of information if enough of them are deployed. The LANUV, in this case, 
							can be used for validating the measurements from the sensebox and the bike.
